# Data-Containers-C
My own data containers in c, capable of working with every type of variable.

Types of containers and their methods:
- Queue (pop),
- Stack (back),
- List (pop, back, getAt, setAt, getFirst, getLast)

Every container also contains functions: addToContainer, createContainer, deleteContainer, sizeOfContainer.
